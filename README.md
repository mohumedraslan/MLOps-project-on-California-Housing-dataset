# California Housing Price Prediction MLOps Pipeline
A streamlined MLOps project for predicting housing prices in California, built with Python, scikit-learn, Streamlit, and more. This pipeline processes the California Housing dataset, trains a Random Forest model, and deploys it as an interactive web app.

## Features
Data Exploration: Analyzes the California Housing dataset in a Jupyter Notebook.
Model Training: Trains a Random Forest model with scikit-learn for accurate predictions.
App Deployment: Deploys the model as an interactive web app using Streamlit.
Live Demo: Access the deployed app for real-time predictions.
## Tech Stack
Python, pandas, scikit-learn
Jupyter Notebook for data exploration
Streamlit for app deployment
Pickle for model serialization
